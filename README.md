## What You Can Do

✅ **Ask AI about your documentation**: *"What's our API authentication process?"*  
✅ **Search across all spaces**: *"Find all pages about security best practices"*  
✅ **Get instant answers**: *"Show me the latest release notes from the Product space"*  
✅ **Access team knowledge**: *"What are our HR policies for remote work?"*  
✅ **Review page comments**: *"Show me the discussion on the architecture document"*  
✅ **Find specific content**: *"Search for pages with 'onboarding' in the title"*  

## Perfect For

- **Developers** who need quick access to technical documentation and API guides
- **Product Managers** searching for requirements, specs, and project updates
- **HR Teams** accessing policy documents and employee resources quickly  
- **Support Teams** finding troubleshooting guides and knowledge base articles
- **Anyone** who wants to interact with Confluence using natural language

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 2 minutes:

### 1. Get Your Confluence Credentials

Generate a Confluence API Token:
1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a name like **"AI Assistant"**
4. **Copy the generated token** immediately (you won't see it again!)

> 💡 **Working with a public Confluence site?** You can skip the email and API token steps. Set only `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME` and the server will use anonymous access, returning any content that is publicly visible.

### 2. Try It Instantly

```bash
# Set your credentials
export ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME="your-company"  # for your-company.atlassian.net

# Optional: only needed for private spaces or pages
export ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL="your.email@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your_copied_token"

If you only need public data, set `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME` and skip the email/token.

# List your Confluence spaces
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence ls-spaces

# Get details about a specific space
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence get-space --space-key DEV

# Search for pages
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence search --query "API documentation"
```

## Connect to AI Assistants

### For Claude Desktop Users

Add this to your Claude configuration file (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "confluence": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence"],
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-company",
        "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME` is required. Omit the email and API token if you only need access to public Confluence content.

Restart Claude Desktop, and you'll see "🔗 confluence" in the status bar.

### For Other AI Assistants

Most AI assistants support MCP. Install the server globally:

```bash
npm install -g @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the MCP server with STDIO transport.

### Alternative: Configuration File

Create `~/.mcp/configs.json` for system-wide configuration:

```json
{
  "confluence": {
    "environments": {
      "ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-company",
      "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
      "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
    }
  }
}
```

As above, `ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME` is mandatory while the user email and API token are optional for private spaces.

**Alternative config keys:** The system also accepts `"atlassian-confluence"`, `"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence"`, or `"mcp-server-atlassian-confluence"` instead of `"confluence"`.

## Real-World Examples

### 📚 Explore Your Knowledge Base

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"List all the spaces in our Confluence"*
- *"Show me details about the Engineering space"*  
- *"What pages are in our Product space?"*
- *"Find the latest pages in the Marketing space"*

### 🔍 Search and Find Information

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Search for pages about API authentication"*
- *"Find all documentation with 'security' in the title"*
- *"Show me pages labeled with 'getting-started'"*
- *"Search for content in the DEV space about deployment"*

### 📄 Access Specific Content

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Get the content of the API Authentication Guide page"*
- *"Show me the onboarding checklist document"*
- *"What's in our security policies page?"*
- *"Display the latest release notes"*

### 💬 Review Discussions

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Show me comments on the architecture design document"*
- *"What feedback was left on the new feature proposal?"*
- *"Display discussion on the API changes page"*

### 🎯 Advanced Searches

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Find all pages created by John in the last month"*
- *"Show me archived pages in the Product space"*
- *"Search for pages with both 'API' and 'tutorial' labels"*
- *"Find documentation updated in the last week"*

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "403 Forbidden"

1. **Check your API Token permissions**:
   - Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   - Make sure your token is still active and has the right permissions

2. **Verify your site name**:
   ```bash
   # Test your credentials work
   npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence ls-spaces
   ```

3. **Check your site name format**:
   - If your Confluence URL is `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`
   - Your site name should be just `mycompany`
4. **Using anonymous access?**:
   - Only publicly shared spaces and pages can be retrieved without credentials
   - Add `ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL` and `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` if the content requires sign-in

### "Space not found" or "Page not found"

1. **Check space key spelling**:
   ```bash
   # List your spaces to see the correct keys
   npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-confluence ls-spaces
   ```

2. **Verify access permissions**:
   - Make sure you have access to the space in your browser
   - Some spaces may be restricted to certain users

### "No results found" when searching

1. **Try broader search terms**:
   - Use single keywords instead of full phrases
   - Try different variations of your search terms

2. **Check space permissions**:
   - You can only search content you have permission to view
   - Ask your admin if you should have access to specific spaces

### Claude Desktop Integration Issues

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** after updating the config file
2. **Check the status bar** for the "🔗 confluence" indicator
3. **Verify config file location**:
   - macOS: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What permissions do I need?

Your Atlassian account needs:
- **Read access** to the Confluence spaces you want to search
- **API token** with appropriate permissions (automatically granted when you create one)

### Can I use this with Confluence Server (on-premise)?

Currently, this tool only supports **Confluence Cloud**. Confluence Server support may be added in future versions.

### How do I find my site name?

Your site name is the first part of your Confluence URL:
- URL: `https://mycompany.atlassian.net` → Site name: `mycompany`
- URL: `https://acme-corp.atlassian.net` → Site name: `acme-corp`

### What AI assistants does this work with?

Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP):
- Claude Desktop (most popular)
- Cursor AI
- Continue.dev
- Many others

### Is my data secure?

Yes! This tool:
- Runs entirely on your local machine
- Uses your own Confluence credentials
- Never sends your data to third parties
